# dag-pb-online

## Deprecated May 2023

Use [ipld-dag-online](https://github.com/ardislu/ipld-dag-online) instead.

This is a minimal webpage for quickly using [js-dag-pb](https://github.com/ipld/js-dag-pb) without installing or setting up anything. 

It imports the library and exposes it to DevTools. There's also a minimal UI to quickly dag-pb encode a file.
